# Day 03 – Git, GitHub, Scrum & Agile Notes

## Git & Version Control
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in code, enables collaboration, and maintains project history safely.
- Install Git and configure:
  - git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  - git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
- Initialize repository → git init
- Clone existing repo → git clone <url>
- Check files → ls
- Change directory → cd folder / cd ..
- Check status → git status
- Add changes → git add .
- Commit → git commit -m "message"
- Pull updates → git pull origin main
- Push changes → git push origin main
- Stages: Modified → Staged → Committed

## GitHub
GitHub is a cloud platform to host Git repositories, collaborate with teams, manage issues, and track versions.
- Create account
- Create repository
- Push local code to remote
- Collaborate via branches & pull requests

## Command Line Basics
- dir / ls → list files
- bash → shell to execute commands
- Terminal helps interact directly with the system

## Agile Methodology
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development.
### Core Values
- Individuals over processes
- Working software over documentation
- Collaboration over contracts
- Responding to change over plans

## Scrum
A framework that applies Agile practices.
- Sprint: short development cycle
- Sprint Review: demo work to stakeholders
- Sprint Retrospective: improve process
- Velocity: work completed per sprint
- Story Points: effort estimation

## Learning Highlights
- Practiced Git commands
- Understood repository workflow
- Learned Agile mindset and Scrum process
- Connected development practices with real projects
